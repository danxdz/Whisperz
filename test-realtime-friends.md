# Test Real-Time Friend Updates

## What's Changed
Friends now update in **real-time** using Gun DB's `.on()` subscriptions instead of polling every 10 seconds!

### Key Improvements:

1. **Real-time Subscriptions** in `friendsService.js`:
   - `subscribeToFriends()` now listens to BOTH:
     - User's own `friends` space 
     - Public `friendships` space
   - Uses `.on()` instead of `.once()` for live updates

2. **Instant Updates**:
   - When User B accepts User A's invite
   - User A sees User B appear **immediately** (no refresh needed!)
   - Both users are notified in real-time

## How to Test

### Test 1: Basic Friend Addition
1. Open app in Browser A (User A)
2. Generate invite link
3. Open invite in Browser B (User B) 
4. Accept invite as User B
5. **Expected**: User A sees User B appear instantly in friends list (no refresh!)

### Test 2: Multiple Windows
1. Login as same user in 2 browser tabs
2. In Tab 1: Generate invite
3. In another browser: Accept invite
4. **Expected**: Both Tab 1 and Tab 2 show new friend immediately

### Test 3: Verify No Polling
1. Open browser DevTools > Network tab
2. Watch for Gun DB activity
3. Accept an invite from another user
4. **Expected**: Friend appears without periodic polling requests

## Technical Details

The system uses Gun DB's real-time sync:
- `.on()` creates persistent subscriptions
- Changes propagate instantly across all connected clients
- No need for `setInterval` or manual refresh
- More efficient and responsive than polling

## Benefits
✅ Instant updates (< 100ms typically)
✅ Lower bandwidth usage (no polling)
✅ Better user experience
✅ Works across multiple tabs/devices
✅ Truly P2P real-time sync
