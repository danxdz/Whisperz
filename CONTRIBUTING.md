## Style Guidelines

### JavaScript/React Style Guide

We use ESLint to maintain code quality. Please ensure your code passes linting:

```bash
npm run lint
```

**Key Guidelines:**
- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer `const` over `let`, avoid `var`
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Keep components small and focused
- Use proper React patterns (hooks, context, etc.)

### CSS Style Guide

- Use CSS variables for theming
- Follow BEM naming convention for classes
- Keep specificity low
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Use semantic HTML elements

### File Organization

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/       # Business logic and API services
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/          # Utility functions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/     # React components (when refactored)
