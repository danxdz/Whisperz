# Why We Use Public Peers (And How to Go Private)

## ü§î Why Public Peers?

### **Current Setup:**
```javascript
// We connect to these public relays:
- https://relay.peer.ooo/gun
- https://gun-relay.herokuapp.com/gun
- https://gunjs.herokuapp.com/gun
```

### **Reasons:**

1. **üì° NAT/Firewall Bypass**
   - Most users are behind NAT (home routers)
   - Can't accept direct incoming connections
   - Public relays act as "meeting points"

2. **üåç Always Available**
   - 24/7 uptime
   - Users can connect from anywhere
   - No need to run your own server

3. **ü§ù Network Bootstrap**
   - Need at least ONE relay to find other peers
   - Public relays help peers discover each other

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **The Privacy Problem:**

**Public relays can potentially see:**
- ‚ùå When you're online
- ‚ùå Your IP address
- ‚ùå Encrypted message metadata (not content)
- ‚ùå Who you're connecting with (public keys)

**But they CANNOT see:**
- ‚úÖ Your private messages (encrypted)
- ‚úÖ Your password
- ‚úÖ Your private data (SEA encrypted)

## üîí **Solution: Your Own Private Relay**

### **Option 1: Completely Private Network**
```bash
# Run your own Gun relay
npm install -g gun
gun --port 8765

# In DevTools, remove ALL public relays
# Add only: http://your-server.com:8765/gun
```

**Result:** 
- ‚úÖ 100% private
- ‚úÖ You control everything
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Only users with your relay URL can connect
- ‚ö†Ô∏è You're responsible for uptime

### **Option 2: Hybrid (Recommended)**
```javascript
// Use your relay + public fallbacks
customRelays: [
  'https://your-private-relay.com/gun',  // Primary
  'https://relay.peer.ooo/gun'           // Fallback
]
```

**Result:**
- ‚úÖ Privacy when possible
- ‚úÖ Fallback if your relay is down
- ‚úÖ Better availability

### **Option 3: VPN/Tor Relay**
```javascript
// Run Gun relay behind Tor
gun --port 8765
// Access via: http://youronionaddress.onion/gun
```

**Result:**
- ‚úÖ Anonymous relay
- ‚úÖ Hidden location
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Slower connections

## üöÄ **How to Set Up Your Private Relay**

### **Quick Setup (Local Testing):**
```bash
# Install Gun
npm install -g gun

# Run relay
gun --port 8765

# Add to app (in DevTools Gun DB tab):
http://localhost:8765/gun
```

### **Production Setup (VPS/Cloud):**
```bash
# On your server (e.g., DigitalOcean, AWS)
npm install -g gun pm2

# Create Gun relay service
echo "gun --port 8765" > start-gun.sh
pm2 start start-gun.sh --name gun-relay

# Setup nginx reverse proxy (optional)
server {
  listen 443 ssl;
  server_name relay.yourdomain.com;
  
  location /gun {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:8765;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
  }
}
```

### **Docker Setup:**
```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
RUN npm install -g gun
EXPOSE 8765
CMD ["gun", "--port", "8765"]
```

## üéØ **Best Practices:**

1. **For Development/Testing:**
   - Use public relays (convenient)
   - Add `test01.local` for isolated testing

2. **For Private Groups:**
   - Run your own relay
   - Share URL only with trusted users
   - No public relay fallbacks

3. **For Production:**
   - Multiple private relays for redundancy
   - Geographic distribution
   - Monitor uptime

## üí° **The Bottom Line:**

- **Public Peers** = Convenience + Discovery
- **Private Peers** = Control + Privacy
- **Hybrid** = Best of both worlds

You can start with public peers and gradually move to private as needed. The app supports switching anytime through DevTools!

## üîê **Security Note:**

Even with public relays:
- Messages are end-to-end encrypted (WebRTC)
- Invites are digitally signed (SEA)
- Private data is encrypted (Gun SEA)

Public relays see encrypted traffic, not content!
